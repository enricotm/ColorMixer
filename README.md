------------------------ Color Mixer ------------------------
---
A small web application to mix colors and find the best percentages for a specific color.

How does it work?
---
You can choose by up to 4 colors, just by clicking on them and dragging the small circle, or, if you prefer, directly putting either the rgb value or the hex code.  
By default, the application just create a simple gradient for the 2 first colors but you can change that by adding the "Cor final". With that, you can then select a final color, the same way as the others, and the program will find the best percentage mixture from your inicial colors to get the final one.  
Also, when this feature its on, the gradient will show the two most relevant colors for the mixture, but not necessarily they would be the only ones used.

Disclaimer
---
The web application its in portuguese. I'm sorry if you can't speak this language. However, it is very much possible to still test it out as its functionality its super simple.
